            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>A TESTIMONY CONCERNING George Ruſſel, Who Dyed a Priſoner upon Truth's account for bearing his Teſtimony againſt TYTHES.</head>
               <head type="sub">Together with a Few Lines once more (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many) by way of Information, Caution and Warning unto all Perſecutors, from the Example of the <hi>Jews,</hi> To beware what they do, how they perſiſt and go on in ſuch Practices, leſt the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Juſt God take hold on them, and there be none to deliver out of his Hand. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he will ariſe ere long in his Anger, and plead his own Cauſe in the Earth; and then he will eaſe himſelf of his Adverſaries, and be avenged upon his Enemies.</head>
               <p>Theſe to all People may inform;<lb/> THat <hi>George Ruſſel,</hi> of the Pariſh of <hi>Burliſcombe</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> being Aged about Eighty Three Years (whoſe Body is now Reſcued by the God of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:207482:2"/>Heaven and Earth, from the Envy and Rage of his Cruel Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors; and as concerning him, that Teſtimony is now finiſhed, his Soul being gathered unto God, and to the Spirits of Juſt Men who formerly ſuffered, he now ſleepeth and is at Reſt with them, where the Wicked ceaſe from troubling, and where the Weary be at Reſt, where the Priſoners Reſt together, they hear not the Voice of the Oppreſſor.) He for Conſcience ſake in Obedience to the Commands of Chriſt, refuſing to pay Tythes to one <hi>William Chamberline,</hi> alias <hi>Luckly,</hi> of the ſame Pariſh, Tythemenger, for about one Acre and — of Wheat (the Tythe of which is valued to be worth about 7 s.) was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paened into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and for not Appearing, a Writ was taken out againſt him to attach and impriſon his Body, in the Name of one <hi>Anne Jones</hi> Widow of <hi>Greencham</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Aſhbritle</hi> and County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> Impropriator of the Tythe of <hi>Burliſcombe</hi> aforeſaid. And about the 17th day of the 4th moneth, 1679. his Body was attached, and committed unto Priſon in <hi>Thomas</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Exon,</hi> where he remained a Priſoner about ſeven or eight Weeks; in which time of his being there, ſome Friend of his conſidering his Age, and perceiving the Weakneſs of his Body, in tender Love and Reſpect to him, he being ſeveral Miles diſtant from his Children, who ſhould take Care of him as Age and Weakneſs doth require, thought good to ſeek his Releaſment, which was accordingly obtained: But the Adverſary not regarding his Age, Weakneſs, nor the Ground of his detaining Tythe (which was only for Conſcience ſake) nor the Smalneſs of the Sum demanded to be due (which if <hi>G. R.</hi> had paid, he muſt make Shipwrack of a Good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Peace with God) in much Hardneſs of Heart by this Adverſary the Action was again revived, and another Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came forth, and his Body was apprehended and carryed unto Priſon upon the 11th of the 12th moneth, 1679. and there he remained Priſoner about eleaven Weeks (having ſome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from the Keeper to be without the Keys) until the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of the 3d Moneth, 1680. and then (it being the Firſt day of the Week) in the Morning Weakneſs coming on much upon him, ſo that before any could ſend for his Children to come unto him he gave up the Ghoſt, and Peaceably Dyed (as many
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:207482:2"/>Hearts are perſwaded) in the Love and Favour of God, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Spirit unto him that gave it, there being preſent with him at that time, another Friend, by Name <hi>Robert Welch,</hi> who hath been alſo in the Sheriff, Cuſtody, a Priſoner ſeveral Years, and ſtill remaineth there upon the Account of Tythes. And now his Body being removed from off the Earth, and his Bed made in the Duſt, his Life ſhall Reign in Dominion over the Hearts of his Adverſaries: And by Death he having Overcome and gotten Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over them all, through Chriſt, who hath ſtrengthened him; and having thus Suffered for him, ſhall undoubtedly Reign with him in that Glory at the Right Hand of God, where with the Son was Glorified with the Father from the Beginning, where the Deſtroying, Perſecuting Spirit ſhall never come.</p>
               <p>And his Teſtimony to the Truth againſt Tythes, he having thus ſuffered in Priſon till Death for it, hath as it were in ſome ſence ſealed it with his Blood, and it ſhall ſtand as a Memorial, and ſtanding Teſtimony recorded to Ages and Generations to come, againſt and over all the Heads of ſuch Perſecuting Prieſts, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriators and Tythemongers whatſoever, who endeavour to make void the Law of Chriſt, and the Goſpel of Chriſt; and who walk contrary to him, and are not found treading in his Foot-ſteps, nor in the Foot-ſteps of the Flock, <hi>viz.</hi> his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who received not Tythes, neither Sued any man at the Law, nor caſt any in Priſon for the not Payment thereof: But otherwiſe their Lord and Maſter Chriſt commanded them, ſaying, <hi>As ye go, Preach, ſaying, the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give; freely miniſter of the Ability God hath given to you, whether things Spiritual or Temporal</hi> as alſo ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.—And further ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Into whatſoever City, Town or Houſe ye come, inquire who is Worthy, and if they receive you well, let your Peace then reſt upon it, and in the ſame Houſe remain eating and drinking ſuch things as they give; for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer is worthy of his Hire: Go not from Houſe to Houſe. But if they receive you not;</hi> What then? <hi>Shake off the Duſt of your Shoes that cleaveth to your Feet as a Teſtimony againſt them; and it ſhall be</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah

                  <hi>in the Day of Judgment than for that City,</hi> Luke 10.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. as more largely in the Scriptures may be read.</p>
               <p>So all may ſee how contrary ſuch are, in Life and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Work and Practice to the Doctrine of Chriſt, and to the practice of the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (though they pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) who take and plunder away by a Law the Goods of innocent ſober People, and who caſt in Priſon their Bodies, and many times detain them there till Death. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this will not ſerve their turn in the Day of Account, when God ſhall Judge the ſecrets of all Hearts; their Law then will not ſtand them by in any ſtead to appeaſe or pacify the Anger and Wrath of God that will break forth upon ſuch, if they Repent not; neither will it excuſe them for their Cruelty in the ſight of God, no more than did that Law which the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> made uſe of to crucifie Chriſt by, who thought they did well in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to Death, cryed out and ſaid, <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to dye: Crucifie him, Crucifie him; let his Blood be upon us and upon our Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay, <hi>What Law had they?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant of God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.16. <hi>And he that blaſphemeth the Name of the Lord ſhall ſurely be put to Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the chief Prieſts and Elders falſly accuſing Chriſt, ſaid <hi>he was a Blaſphemer:</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>he hath made himſelf the Son of God.</hi> Then ſaid the High Prieſt, <hi>He hath ſpoken Blaſphemy; what further need have we of Witneſſes? Behold now ye have heard his Blaſphemy: What think ye? They Anſwered and ſaid, He is guilty of Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in ſome ſenſe it is with many in this Nation, who cry out, and ſay, <hi>Tythes</hi> (that unjuſt Oppreſſion, under which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion groans) <hi>are our Due, we have a Law for it; and though there is a People that for Conſcience ſake refuſe to pay it, and ſay, its not our Due by the Law of God and Chriſt</hi> (though you claim it by the Law of Man) <hi>yet ſay we</hi> (Prieſts and Impropriators) <hi>by our Law they ought to Pay, if not, they ſhall ſurely Suffer, we will proſecute the Law; And as for the Judgments of God that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:207482:3"/>may enſue therefore, either here or hereafter, wee'l venture it, let them fall on us: And as to the Curſe that may follow for our Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; if any be, let that reſt upon our Poſterity.</hi> Well, if of ſuch a mind, who ever thou art, mind a little further, and conſider the ſad ſtate afterwards of thoſe Perſecuting, Mudering <hi>Jews,</hi> (of whom Chriſt ſaid, <hi>It was almoſt impoſſible for a Prophet or a man of God to Periſh but amongſt them</hi>) of whom once Tythes under the Law were required, and freely without any Carnal Compulſion was it then to be brought into the place appointed; and it was for ſuch uſes and purpoſes as God by his Servant <hi>Moſes</hi> had ordained it in that Day: which Tythes and Offerings under that <hi>Levitical</hi> Diſpenſation. Prieſthood and Miniſtry, when thus brought into the Store-Houſes, were allotted for the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> who had no Inheritance or ſhare of Land among their Brethren, and who ſerved the Tabernacle, and who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Altar, and alſo for the Relief of the Poor, the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the Fatherleſs, and the Widows that were within their Gates. So then not only for the Prieſts to enrich themſelves thereby, nor to Feed and Cloath themſelves only with the Profits thereof; Nay, nay: Nor yet for greedy Impropriators, who through Covetouſneſs, and for the Love of Money, which is the Root of all Evil, that they might build their Neſts high, and be greater in the Earth, by joyning Houſe to Houſe, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Field to Field, purchaſed to themſelves (meeting with a cheap Bargain) as their Inheritance, that which was other mens Rights; and now ſuch live upon, as may be ſaid, the Labour and and Sweat of other mens Brows, which Purchaſe they never had from God, Truth and Equity any juſt Right unto, nor by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> can demand or recover it; for at that time theſe things were accounted Holy things, and as Offerings were to be dedicated to the Lord; not to be Bought, not to be Sold, not to be Set or Let after ſuch a manner, unto Impropriators, Tythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers or Farmers, there was no ſuch Doings then—neither did <hi>Moſes</hi> ordain a Priſon to caſt mens Bodies in if they brought not in their Tythes according to appointment, nor did he or the Magiſtrates then iſſue forth Writs, Warrants and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions (as the men of our Nation have done) that Wicked Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Bailiffs, and ſuch like, ſhould take mens Goods away by

               <p>And yet all this is done and ſuffered to be done in this Nation under a Profeſſion of the Goſpel, and of Chriſtianity, and under pretence of Laws made by Chriſtian-Magiſtrates, who think to uphold their Chriſtian-Miniſters (as they ſuppoſe) thereby; and ſo hereby they have much ſtrengthened the hands of all cruel perſecuting Prieſts and Impropriators, who are ready enough to take the utmoſt Advantage that the Law will give them herein againſt ſuch Honeſt Sober People: all which Doings are very contrary unto the Mind of God, who hateth Oppreſſion, and to the Command of Chriſt Jeſus, who came to ſet Free from the Yoke of Bondage; and to the Scriptures of Truth, which do not at all juſtifie them; &amp; alſo to that very Law and Diſpenſation that came by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which never did allow of ſuch Practices as theſe, who in that very Day, as on this account, annexed no corporal Penalty thereunto, but left the People under the ſenſe of the Severity of that Judgment, Curſe or Puniſhment, that God himſelf might inflict upon them, i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I Have well known the ſaid <hi>George Ruſſel</hi> for more than twenty years paſt, and ſince my Knowledge of him I have this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony for him, That in the general he was a man of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Harmleſs Converſation towards all men, loving his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himſelf, and willing to do to all men as he would they ſhould do unto him; he received Truth in the Love of it; he was a man of a very Tender Spirit, being often melted into Tears in the ſenſe of the Lord's Preſence, and Love of God towards him; and made it his Concern in his Capacity to gather &amp; bring others to the Knowledge &amp; Enjoyment of the ſame Love, often viſiting his Neighbours and Acquaintance, inviting and perſwading them to accept of, and not to neglect the Day of their Viſitation, putting them in mind of their Latter-end and Day of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; inviting and calling upon his Neighbours and Friends, as Opportunity might be had, to come and hear the Declaration of Truth, freely giving up himſelf and all that he had for its Service, it being the Joy of his Heart to obtain an Opportunity to be ſerviceable to the Lord and his People, and to Receive and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:207482:6"/>Entertain the Lord's Servants, eſpecially ſuch whom the Lord ſent forth as Labourers in his Vineyard; and the Lord's Bleſſing in all was with him; for he ſaw Truth's Proſperity, and many of his Acquaintance brought to the Knowledge of it. He was faithful in his Teſtimony againſt the Falſe Worſhips and Vain Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the World, and in particular againſt that great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of TYTHES, wherein his Concern was but ſmall, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but a ſmall Eſtate as to the outward; and though the Matter was but ſmall on that account required of him, yet he choſe rather to lay down his Life a Priſoner, than to make ſhipwrack of a good Conſcience.</p>
               <p>And I cannot well omit the taking notice of the Sottiſh Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Deſperate Hardneſs of his Adverſary (not often to be parallell'd) who not regarding his Age of Eighty Three Years, his Weakneſs (which uſually attends ſuch Old Age) the Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sum required, or that by their Law might be due, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Seven or Eight Shillings, nor the Ground or Cauſe of his Refuſal to pay it, which was only for Good Conſcience ſake, of which he could not make Shipwrack for all the Riches of this World; however (it ſeems) ſuch was the Hard-hearted Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of this Adverſary (as being of that Generation whoſe Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies are Cruel) he <hi>reſolved to have his Tythes or his Life.</hi> But honeſt <hi>G. R.</hi> choſe rather to lay down this Mortal Life than hazard the Loſs of Everlaſting Life. He was a man greatly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the Love of God towards him, and in the Proſperity of the Lord's Work, and of a very Contented and Chearful Life and Converſation, even living above Viſible Things. I was with him in the time of his late Impriſonment, where though he was weak and feeble of Body, lying on the Bed, yet he manifeſted great Joy and Gladneſs of Spirit, rejoycing in the Goodneſs and Love of God towards him, ſaying, <hi>It was never better with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo having ſealed his Teſtimony with his Life, his Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al is bleſſed, and his innocent harmleſs Life, his tender melting Spirit, and the often appearance of the Springs of Life in him, and the precious Fellowſhip which therein we enjoyed with him, ſtill yields a good Savour to many of the Lord's Faithful Ones which are left behind, and is freſh in our Remembrance, and

               <p>And ſo, let his Name ſtand recorded amongſt the Noble Army of the Lamb's Followers, as one of them who loved not his Life to the Death, and hath overcome through Sufferings, by the Blood of the Lamb and the Word of his Teſtimony, and is now with the Lord's Redeemed Ones on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> where there is an End of Sorrow and Suffering, and all Tears are wip't away; and where everlaſting Praiſes and Halelujah, Honour, Dominion and Thankſgiving are ſounded forth and returned to the Lord, and to the Lamb, who was dead and is alive, who ſits upon the Throne, and lives and raigns over all forever and for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
